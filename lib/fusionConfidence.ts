// paths (citizen report, crowd-corroborated promotion, ambient scan).

// score plus a small satellite nudge in one, a flat max() in another — while
// all three *displayed* fixed visualWeight/sensorWeight/satelliteWeight
// percentages next to the number as if it were a real weighted fusion. It
// wasn't: the weights were static constants that never entered the actual
// calculation, and ambient (sensor/satellite-only) incidents displayed a
// "Visual X%" figure despite having no photo at all.
//
// This module makes the weights real: every source that actually has data
// gets scored 0-100 on the same scale, missing sources are excluded (not
// zeroed), and the displayed weights are the *actual* normalized weights
// used to compute finalConfidence — not decoration.
